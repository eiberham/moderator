A chrome extension to hack chat-ingles platform :fire:   


Well i wanted to develop this extension in order to have a more intuitive user-friendly interface to take advantage of all the
breaches this chatroom has in order to let those who don't know a little bit about web programming gain privileges they don't
have.

So this basically lets you become the chatroom moderator, which means you can know additional information about connected users
like their email, whether they're on the mobile app or the web app, who ignores you, and also you'll have the option to kick out 
those users who lash people out.
